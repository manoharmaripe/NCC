                    The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is the youth wing of the Indian Armed Forces with its headquarters in
                    New Delhi, India. It is open to school and college students on a voluntary basis as a Tri-Services
                    Organisation, comprising the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, engaged in developing the youth of
                    the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens. The soldier youth foundation in India is a
                    voluntary organization which recruits cadets from high schools, higher secondary, colleges and
                    universities all over India. The cadets are given basic military training in small arms and drill.
                    The officers and cadets have no liability for active military service once they complete their
                    course. The emblem of the NCC consists of 3 colors; red, dark blue and light blue. These colors
                    represent the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force respectively. The 17 lotuses indicate
                    the 17 directories of India.

            <div class="content-title-para">
                <p>The ‘Aim’ of the NCC laid out in 1988 have stood the test of time and continue to meet the
                    requirements expected of it in the current socio–economic scenario of the country. The NCC aims at
                    developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals
                    of selfless service amongst young citizens. Further, it aims at creating a pool of organized,
                    trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities in all walks of life, who will serve the
                    Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless to say, the NCC also provides an environment
                    conducive to motivating young Indians to join the armed forces.

                <h2>ORIGIN OF NCC</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content-title-para">
                <p>In the year 1948 a total of 96 units of Senior Division were raised, comprising variety of units to
                    include one Armoured Corps, three Artillery, five Engineers, two Signals and two Medical – and 83
                    companies of Infantry. As there was some delay in the establishment of NCC in UP, Madras and Bihar,
                    whose Govts wanted every student joining NCC to be verified by police prior to enrolment, only
                    20,000 cadets had joined the NCC in the year 1948. The raising of the Junior Division units did not
                    progress well owing to shortage of trained school teachers. The main difficulty was that adequate
                    number of teachers of the desired quality did not come forward to work as NCC officers. There were
                    various administrative reasons attributed to this. Sometimes, colleges and schools were not in a
                    position to spare the teaching staff except during the summer vacation. Thus the NCC which has now13
                    lakh cadets on its rolls, had started with 20,000 cadets in 1948.
